## Documentation

ALWAYS analyze our existing documentation first at docs/ to understand context better.
ALWAYS respect our team guidelines.

### Document first approach

USE `system-analyst` skill when dealing with documentation.

We maintain document first approach.
We try to keep documentation in a human readable format, mostly in md files.
Our documentation should serve as a source of truth.
Everything (use cases, flows, tests) should be implemented based on the documentation.
This way, we can ensure that the documentation and the implementation are in sync.

## Testing and development

USE `golang-developer` skill for testing and development.
